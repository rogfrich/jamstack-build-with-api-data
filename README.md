# Basic Eleventy Site for practicing collaboration with Git

This is based on **Example 3 - Building with a static site generator** from [Phil Hawksworth's excellent JAMStack introduction](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/03/12/learn-jamstack-with-a-free-3.5-hour-video-of-demos-and-examples/) There is a link on the above page to this example.

My original intention was to base this Repo on **Example 4 - Generating pages from a content API** but when I was working through the previous examples in order to remind myself just how to get to this setup, I realised that **Example 3** is a nice very basic site to start with. It could be that we evolve the site into the next couple of examples.

Note that the way this site is configured has all of the source under the `src` folder and output goes into `dest`. Further notes on how this is configured can be found in the `elevent-setup.MD` file, which annoyingly is spelled incorrectly...

You should be able to add a basic page simply by coping (for example) the `about.njk` file in the `src` folder and it should end up being deployed into its own folder.
